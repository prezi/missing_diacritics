# Missing_diacritics project for Prezi Editor
Repository for creating missed diacritical marks and other requested glyphs for fonts used in Prezi Editor under SIL Open Font License v1.10 (http://scripts.sil.org/OFL). "From where you are" and "KG Empire of Dirt" are not under public licence. For folder hierarchy we will use weiweihuanghuang's folder structure http://weiweihuanghuang.github.io/Work-Sans/. Every font has it's own folder. 

This is the font list:

Aleo

Cabin

Comic Zine OT

Crimson Text

Komika Title

Orbitron

Questrial
